# Weather Logging System Final Project

This project utilizes various sensors from the Smart Home IOT Sensor Kit to gather data on the weather nearby.
Then, the collected data is presented by a flask served website in which the data is formatted into easily readable charts.
This is all done by connecting the DHT11 Temperature & Humidity sensor, the BMP180 Digital Barometric Pressure Sensor module,
and the Water sensor Module to the GPIO board which is connected to and powered by the Pi.
